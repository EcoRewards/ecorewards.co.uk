With the beautiful new pedestrianised Lexicon Centre and well-designed cycleways,
Bracknell Forest is already leading the way when it comes to encouraging walking
and cycling. A new initiative from Bracknell Forest Council wants to capitalise on the
behavioural shift that has come about as a result of the pandemic lockdown. With
more people walking and cycling and less cars on the road there has been a marked
improvement in air quality, not just in Bracknell but all around the globe.

The Eco Rewards Trial, launched jointly by Bracknell Forest Council and Thames
Valley Berkshire Smart City Cluster, will incentivise residents to maintain green travel
and healthy lifestyle choices. Employers in the Business Improvement District (BID)
can also encourage their staff and customers to participate.
