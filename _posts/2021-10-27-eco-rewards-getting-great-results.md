With climate change firmly in the news and with COP 26 coming up, **Eco Rewards**, an award-
winning scheme addressing climate change, is currently **achieving  spectacular  results** in
Bracknell Forest.  Eco Rewards participants have already shown a **51% behavioural shift** to
mainly walking and cycling as well as other forms of sustainable transport.  In the recent MJ
awards,  the  **Thames  Valley  Berkshire  Smart  City  Cluster**  was  awarded  **Best  Digital
Transformation***, and Eco Rewards was highlighted as one of the successful schemes funded
by the partnership, supported by Bracknell Forest Council.

Eco Rewards offers rewards and incentives through schools, businesses, and the wider
community, to encourage people to choose greener travel and healthier lifestyle options and
reduce local congestion.  **Cycling, walking and green travel journeys** can be reported by
tapping smart tags on blue readers, scanning QR codes or using an online form. League tables,
medals and carbon savings calculator keep motivation high, plus participants can take part in
special challenges, be entered into prize draws and access discounts and cash-back from
thousands of well-known online retailers. They can log their routes, achieve goals, all while
**helping to save the planet**. They also love taking part with one member saying: **“Hi Eco-
Rewards, many thanks, this scheme really gets me walking and active. Kind regards,
Andrew”.**

Another milestone was reached this month when over **200,000 green miles** and over **50
tonnes** of aggregated carbon savings were reported just in Bracknell Forest. To put this into
context, this distance is equivalent to **more than 8 times around the earth!**

Erika Vincent, a director of Eco Rewards said **_“At Eco Rewards we are passionate about
promoting and sustaining green travel and healthy behaviours. Our unique reward scheme
offers incentives to achieve long-term behavioural shift.”_**  It is starting to have a real impact
with local schools in the area, with the Head at Warfield Primary reporting that since the end
of lockdown and joining the scheme: **_“we have much less demand on our carpark and pick
up at the end of the day is running a lot more smoothly”_**.

A recent survey of Bracknell Forest participants in the Eco Rewards scheme showed that most
respondents **47%**, reported driving as their main form of transport before joining. The vast
majority, **82%**, have reported that they are **walking or cycling more** or using green transport,
**up 7% from the last survey**.

**90%** of respondents are worried about the impact of climate change. An amazing **100%** of
respondents are motivated to take **positive steps to help to reverse climate change**.

The survey confirmed a variety of reasons that motivate participation with **rewards, prizes**
and tackling **climate change** dominant. Participants also cited **reporting their green journeys**
and **getting more exercise** as important.

The survey also had some great comments from participants including this one below:  
_**“A  great  scheme  to  "try"  and  educate  and  change  habits  with  pupils  and  their
parents/carers. This has also led us as a school to form an Eco group and join a further eco
scheme”**_
