          Once you have a pre-registered smart tag or card, tap on an Eco Rewards
          reader as you travel to and from work, school or college. We will calculate
          your points, CO<sub>2</sub> savings and green miles. Participants will also be able to report their green journeys via an online form (coming
          soon).
        </p>
        <p>You can see your points, savings
          and access to benefits by completing your registration and logging on to your
          account. If you are joining through a school, community or business we will be
          running prize draws and calculating your group savings.
